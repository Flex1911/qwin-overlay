GNOME 3.16

Status: Build successfully, most of the components works as it should.

ISSUES:
GTK+:
- for now,gtk-update-icon-cache disabled by patch,because it causes file 
collisions between GTK+2 and GTK+3
- builds only with the included tests (forced for now) due to assembly 
errors of gtkgears

gnome-settings-daemon and gnome-control-center:
- not available patches for wacom and colord,because of what now 
their building is required

Common:
- version depenencies isn't correct for some ebuilds.


Installing: 
Just install base gnome from portage and update it from my overlay.
